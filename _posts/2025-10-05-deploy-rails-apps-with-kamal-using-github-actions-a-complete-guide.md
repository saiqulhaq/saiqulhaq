Deploying Rails applications has never been easier thanks to **Kamal** (formerly MRSK) and **GitHub Actions**. In this post, I'll share working examples of how to set up automated deployments that will save you time and reduce deployment friction. Whether you're deploying to a single server or managing multiple environments, this guide has you covered.  

Kamal  
brings Docker-powered deployments to Rails without the complexity of Kubernetes. Combined with  
GitHub Actions, you get:

- **Zero-downtime deployments** with automatic health checks  
- **Push-to-deploy** workflows from your main branch  
- **Multi-environment support** (staging, production)  
- **Built-in rollback** capabilities  
- **No vendor lock-in** â€“ deploy to any VPS

## Github Action Script

### Example 1

Hereâ€™s a straightforward GitHub Actions workflow that deploys whenever you push to the main branch (by nbakush):

```yaml
name: Deploy main branch
concurrency:
  group: production
  cancel-in-progress: true
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  # or manually
  workflow_dispatch:
    # Required for secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN
permissions:
  packages: write
  contents: read
jobs:
  deploy:
    name: deploy
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD }}
      KAMAL_REGISTRY_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.KAMAL_REGISTRY_USERNAME }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [18.x]
    steps:
      - name: Push to Github Container Repository
        uses: Clipr-Group/ghcr-action@v1
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          platforms: linux/amd64,linux/arm64
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up Ruby
        uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
        with:
          ruby-version: 3.3.0
          bundler-cache: true
      - name: Install Kamal
        run: gem install kamal
      - name: Connect to Tailscale (Optional)
        uses: tailscale/github-action@v3
        with:
          authkey: ${{ secrets.TAILSCALE_AUTHKEY }}
      - name: Release kamal lock
        run: kamal lock release
      - name: Run deploy command
        run: kamal deploy -P -v --version latest
```

**Key Features of This Setup:**

- **Concurrency control:** Prevents multiple deploys from running simultaneously
- **Multi-platform builds:** Supports both AMD64 and ARM64 architectures
- **Tailscale integration:** Simplifies server access with friendly hostnames
- **Lock release:** Ensures a clean state before deployment

### Example 2

```yaml
name: Deploy with Kamal
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      environment:
        description: "Environment to deploy to"
        required: true
        default: "production"
        type: choice
        options:
          - production
          - staging
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: ${{ github.event.inputs.environment || 'production' }}
    env:
      DOCKER_BUILDKIT: 1
      RAILS_ENV: production
      SERVER_HOST: ${{ secrets.SERVER_HOST }}
      KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD }}
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.POSTGRES_PASSWORD }}
      RAILS_MASTER_KEY: ${{ secrets.RAILS_MASTER_KEY }}
      SECRET_KEY_BASE: ${{ secrets.SECRET_KEY_BASE }}
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up Ruby
        uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
        with:
          ruby-version: "3.4.4"
          bundler-cache: true
      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3
      - name: Install Kamal
        run: gem install kamal
      - name: Set up SSH
        uses: webfactory/ssh-agent@v0.9.0
        with:
          ssh-private-key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}
      - name: Login to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v3
        with:
          username: xxx
          password: ${{ secrets.KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD }}
      - name: Deploy with Kamal
        run: kamal deploy
```

## Kamal Configuration (`config/deploy.yml`)

Hereâ€™s a production-ready Kamal configuration that includes a database and Redis:

```yaml
# Name of your application
service: service-name
# Container image
image: xxx/xxx
# Deploy to these servers
servers:
  web:
    - <%= ENV["SERVER_HOST"] %>
proxy:
  app_port: 8000
# Registry configuration
registry:
  username: xxx
  password:
    - KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD
# Builder configuration
builder:
  arch: amd64
# Environment variables
env:
  clear:
    RAILS_ENV: production
    NODE_ENV: production
    PORT: 8000
    POSTGRES_HOST: service-name-db
    POSTGRES_PORT: 5432
    POSTGRES_DB: dbname
    POSTGRES_USER: username
    REDIS_URL: redis://service-name-redis:6379/1
    REDIS_HOST: service-name-redis
  secret:
    - RAILS_MASTER_KEY
    - SECRET_KEY_BASE
    - POSTGRES_PASSWORD
# Useful aliases
aliases:
  shell: app exec --interactive --reuse "bash"
  console: app exec --interactive --reuse "bin/rails console"
# Accessory services
accessories:
  db:
    image: postgres:16
    host: <%= ENV["SERVER_HOST"] %>
    port: 5432
    env:
      clear:
        POSTGRES_DB: dbname
        POSTGRES_USER: username
      secret:
        - POSTGRES_PASSWORD
    directories:
      - data: /var/lib/postgresql/data
  redis:
    image: redis:latest
    host: <%= ENV["SERVER_HOST"] %>
    port: 6379
    directories:
      - /var/lib/redis: /data
```

## Required GitHub Secrets

Configure these secrets in your repository settings:  

**Essential Secrets:**

- `KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD`: Docker registry password
- `KAMAL_REGISTRY_USERNAME`: Docker registry username (if using Docker Hub)
- `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`: For server access
- `SERVER_HOST`: Your serverâ€™s IP or hostname

**Rails-specific Secrets:**

- `RAILS_MASTER_KEY`: Rails credentials master key
- `SECRET_KEY_BASE`: Rails secret key base
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: Database password

**Optional:**

- `TAILSCALE_AUTHKEY`: For Tailscale VPN access (simplifies server management)

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

1. **Use Tailscale for Simplified Networking**  
   Instead of managing IP addresses, Tailscale lets you use friendly hostnames.  
   *Optional but highly recommended for teams:*

   ```yaml
   - name: Connect to Tailscale
     uses: tailscale/github-action@v3
     with:
       authkey: ${{ secrets.TAILSCALE_AUTHKEY }}
   ```

2. **Implement Deployment Locks**  
   Always release locks to prevent stuck deployments:

   ```yaml
   - name: Release kamal lock
     run: kamal lock release
   ```

3. **Use Concurrency Groups**  
   Prevent deployment collisions:
   ```yaml
   concurrency:
     group: production
     cancel-in-progress: true
   ```

4. **Separate Accessories Configuration**  
   Keep your database and Redis as Kamal accessories for easier management and persistence.

Combining Kamal with GitHub Actions provides a robust and cost-effective deployment pipeline that rivals enterprise solutions. You get the simplicity of Heroku-style deploys with the flexibility and control of your own infrastructure.  
The beauty of this setup lies in its simplicityâ€”push your code, and GitHub Actions, along with Kamal, handle the rest. No Kubernetes complexity, no vendor lock-in, just straightforward Docker deployments that work.
