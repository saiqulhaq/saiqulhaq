title: Fix FluentBit Warning Messages
---

Managing Fluent Bit configurations and OpenSearch clusters in Kubernetes environments requires addressing challenges such as buffer size limitations, excessive shards, and inefficient index management. Issues like chunk flushing errors and inconsistent log delivery in Fluent Bit can impact log reliability, while optimizing shard configurations, implementing Index State Management policies, and automating data stream cleanup are critical for maintaining OpenSearch performance and data retention efficiency.

## Fluent Bit Configuration Issues
The Fluent Bit configuration in the Kubernetes cluster exhibited several issues, including buffer size limitations and chunk flushing failures. Log messages revealed that some files, particularly faraday.log, required larger buffer sizes to prevent skipping [1]. Chunk flushing errors occurred frequently, with retry attempts scheduled at varying intervals [1]. These problems led to inconsistent log delivery, potentially causing missing or duplicate entries in OpenSearch [2]. To address these issues, recommendations included increasing buffer sizes, optimizing network connections, and fine-tuning Fluent Bit's configuration for improved performance and reliability [3].

## Optimizing OpenSearch Setup
The OpenSearch cluster's performance was hindered by an excessive number of primary shards (700) and inefficient index management. Analysis revealed numerous small indices, some with only 1-2 documents, consuming full shards. To optimize the setup, recommendations included implementing proper Index State Management (ISM) policies, consolidating small indices, and adjusting shard configurations based on data volume. For high-volume indices (>500MB/day), daily rotations were suggested, while medium and low-volume indices were recommended for weekly and monthly rotations, respectively [1](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/administration/monitoring) [2](https://forum.opensearch.org/t/try-the-understand-the-error-failed-to-write-the-request-of-size-4580301-due-to-buffer-capacity-too-small-for-the-number-of-records-18005/20664). These changes aimed to reduce the total shard count to 100-150, aligning with the cluster's resources of 4 CPU and 16GB RAM [3](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72624921/why-i-get-the-failed-to-flush-chunk-error-in-fluent-bit).

## Managing Data Streams in OpenSearch
Data streams in OpenSearch simplify the management of time-series data by abstracting multiple hidden backing indices. They automatically handle index rollovers and enforce append-only time-series data patterns. Each document in a data stream must contain a timestamp field, with write operations directed to the latest backing index. This structure allows for efficient search operations across all backing indices while simplifying index management. To implement data streams, an index template with data stream configuration must be created, after which data ingestion can begin [1] [2]. This approach is particularly beneficial for managing high-volume, time-based data where older documents don't require updates and can be efficiently managed through index lifecycle policies.

## Automating Index Deletion
A bash script was developed to automate the deletion of old indices and data streams in OpenSearch. The script iterates through dates, identifies indices and data streams older than 30 days, and removes them using curl commands. It handles special characters in index names by URL encoding and addresses the challenge of deleting write indices for data streams by first removing the entire data stream. The script uses the `_data_stream/_stats` endpoint to retrieve a comprehensive list of data streams before deletion, ensuring proper handling of all relevant data [1] [2]. This automation helps maintain optimal cluster performance by regularly cleaning up outdated data while preserving the required 30-day retention period.
