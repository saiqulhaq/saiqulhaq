# What is the leader

As a leader, there 
What is about the micromanagers, the blamers, the credit-stealers, the microaggressors, 
the ok, like I said, there are a lot of ways to get it wrong.

The phrase "Accept that managers are overhead" from Cate Huston's book "The Engineering Leader" refers to the concept that managers, while essential, do not directly contribute to the production of the core work (e.g., coding, designing) that the team is responsible for. Instead, their role is to facilitate, support, and optimize the work of their team members. This means that managers are considered an "overhead" cost because they do not produce the primary output themselves but are necessary for the efficient functioning and scaling of the team.

In the context of the book, this idea is part of a broader discussion on leadership and management within engineering teams. Huston emphasizes the importance of managers understanding their role in creating an environment where their team can thrive, rather than trying to directly contribute to the technical work themselves. This involves:

- **Self-Management**: Learning how to manage oneself to avoid common pitfalls that new managers face.
- **Scaling Teams**: Establishing practices and structures that allow the team to grow and function effectively.
- **Defining Impact**: Clarifying the mission and values of the team to ensure everyone is aligned and working towards common goals.

By accepting that they are overhead, managers can focus on their primary responsibilities of leadership, mentorship, and creating a supportive environment, rather than trying to justify their role by directly engaging in technical tasks. This acceptance allows them to better support their team and contribute to the overall success of the organization[1][2][3][4][5][6].


# Team structuring

Introduction
The ideal team structure is a crucial aspect of any organization, as it directly impacts the team's effectiveness and productivity.

## Team Structure Configurations 1
There are various team structure configurations, including one-boss, dual authority, and self-managing teams. Each configuration has its advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of structure depends on the team's size, task, and circumstances.

## Platform Team Structure 2
A platform team structure consists of digital and non-digital teams, with each team having a single owner. The digital teams are responsible for developing the platform's capabilities, while the non-digital teams focus on business operations.

## Self-Organizing Teams 3
Self-organizing teams are essential in agile project management. They blend freedom and responsibility, flexibility and structure, and require team members to be self-disciplined and accountable for their work.

## Large Adaptive Teams 4
Large adaptive teams balance flexibility and structure, with a hub organizational structure, self-organization extensions, team self-discipline, and additional practices. This structure allows for scalability while maintaining the essence of flexibility and semi-autonomy at the individual and subteam level.

## The Gap Between Capability and Requirements

Professionally, whether we’re growing or stagnating is the gap between our current capability and what’s required of us

> NOTE:  
> Capability less than requirements = hard growth (or failure)  
> Capability greater than requirements = stagnation  
> Requirements a bit more than capability but with help = sweet spot  

## Great managers focus on developing strengths

> When they work on weaknesses, it’s to build them up so they’re no longer controlling.

Great managers focus on developing their employees' strengths rather than trying to fix their weaknesses.

The key idea is that everyone has natural talents and strengths, as well as weaknesses. Instead of spending excessive time and effort trying to improve areas where an employee is weak, great managers recognize that it's more productive to identify and cultivate each person's unique strengths.

When it comes to addressing weaknesses, the book suggests that managers should only work on weaknesses that are "controlling weaknesses" - meaning weaknesses that significantly limit or hold back an employee's growth and performance. The goal is not to completely eliminate all weaknesses, but rather to build up those weaknesses just enough so that they are no longer major obstacles or "controlling factors" preventing the employee from excelling in their areas of strength.

By focusing on developing strengths, employees can channel their energy into areas where they have natural abilities and talents, leading to higher engagement, productivity, and job satisfaction. At the same time, by addressing only the most critical weaknesses that hold them back, employees can minimize the constraints imposed by those weaknesses without getting bogged down in trying to become perfect in every area.

In summary, we need to advocate for a strengths-based approach to management, where the primary emphasis is on identifying and nurturing each employee's unique talents and capabilities, while still addressing major weaknesses that act as barriers, but not obsessing over minor weaknesses that don't significantly impede performance.

# Team

Engineering teams have three primary components: people, projects, and process. Strong teams include people who are individually doing well, and they deliver business value, predictably and effectively.

Good teams are not defined by their processes; good teams use and evolve process effectively to meet the organizational need.

People management is a key part of the strategy for scaling a team. People management is how people are hired, how they are onboarded, how they are supported, how they are developed, and how they are rewarded.
