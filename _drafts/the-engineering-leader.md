title: The Engineering Leader
---

What is about the micromanagers, the blamers, the credit-stealers, the microaggressors, 
the ok, like I said, there are a lot of ways to get it wrong.

The phrase "Accept that managers are overhead" from Cate Huston's book "The Engineering Leader" refers to the concept that managers, while essential, do not directly contribute to the production of the core work (e.g., coding, designing) that the team is responsible for. Instead, their role is to facilitate, support, and optimize the work of their team members. This means that managers are considered an "overhead" cost because they do not produce the primary output themselves but are necessary for the efficient functioning and scaling of the team.

In the context of the book, this idea is part of a broader discussion on leadership and management within engineering teams. Huston emphasizes the importance of managers understanding their role in creating an environment where their team can thrive, rather than trying to directly contribute to the technical work themselves. This involves:

- **Self-Management**: Learning how to manage oneself to avoid common pitfalls that new managers face.
- **Scaling Teams**: Establishing practices and structures that allow the team to grow and function effectively.
- **Defining Impact**: Clarifying the mission and values of the team to ensure everyone is aligned and working towards common goals.

By accepting that they are overhead, managers can focus on their primary responsibilities of leadership, mentorship, and creating a supportive environment, rather than trying to justify their role by directly engaging in technical tasks. This acceptance allows them to better support their team and contribute to the overall success of the organization[1][2][3][4][5][6].

Team structuring

Introduction
The ideal team structure is a crucial aspect of any organization, as it directly impacts the team's effectiveness and productivity.

Team Structure Configurations 1
There are various team structure configurations, including one-boss, dual authority, and self-managing teams. Each configuration has its advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of structure depends on the team's size, task, and circumstances.

Platform Team Structure 2
A platform team structure consists of digital and non-digital teams, with each team having a single owner. The digital teams are responsible for developing the platform's capabilities, while the non-digital teams focus on business operations.

Self-Organizing Teams 3
Self-organizing teams are essential in agile project management. They blend freedom and responsibility, flexibility and structure, and require team members to be self-disciplined and accountable for their work.

Large Adaptive Teams 4
Large adaptive teams balance flexibility and structure, with a hub organizational structure, self-organization extensions, team self-discipline, and additional practices. This structure allows for scalability while maintaining the essence of flexibility and semi-autonomy at the individual and subteam level.
