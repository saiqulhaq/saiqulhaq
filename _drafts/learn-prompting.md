# Beginner-friendly; no programming required

## 1. ChatGPT is non-deterministic, It might be give a wrong result

Wrong possibility is high

```markdown
What is 923 * 99?
```

```markdown
923 * 99 equals 91,677.
```


Here is the improved version
```markdown
What is 923 * 99? Let's go step by step.
Always write out the full number of 0s for each term.
```

```markdown
To multiply 923 by 99, we can break it down into smaller steps:

Step 1: Write out the full number of 0s for each term:
923 * 99 = 923 * 990

Step 2: Multiply the first term by 9:
923 * 9 = 8307

Step 3: Multiply the first term by 90 (adding one 0):
923 * 90 = 83070

Step 4: Add the results from step 2 and step 3:
8307 + 83070 = 91377

Therefore, 923 multiplied by 99 is equal to 91,377.
```

This process of refining our prompt over time is known as prompt engineering. You will never write the perfect prompt on your first try, so it is important to get good at refining your prompt.

## 2. ðŸŸ¢ Essay Evaluation and Feedback Example

```markdown
Read the following excerpt from an essay and provide feedback based on the following criteria: grammar, clarity, coherence, argument quality, and use of evidence.
Provide a score from 1-10 for each attribute, along with reasoning for your score.

"Despite the popular belief, there's no solid evidence supporting the idea that video games lead to violent behavior. Research on the topic is often contradictory and inconclusive. Some studies found a correlation, but correlation don't imply causation. So, it's premature to blame video games for violence in society.
```

```markdown
Attribute: Grammar Score: 9 Reasoning: The essay is mostly grammatically correct, but there is a minor error - 'correlation don't imply causation' should be 'correlation doesn't imply causation'.
Attribute: Clarity
Score: 8
Reasoning: The essay is generally clear, but could provide more detail or explanation about the contradictory and inconclusive nature of the research.  Attribute: Coherence
Score: 8
Reasoning: The arguments are coherent and related, but the transition between them could be smoother.  Attribute: Argument Quality
Score: 7
Reasoning: The argument presented is logical and well-reasoned, but it could be strengthened with a clearer statement of the writer's position on the issue.
```

We can use them to evaluate a Google Form submission too.
