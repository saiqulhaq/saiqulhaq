Hello! My name is Saiqul Haq, and I'm the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at Hungry Hub, a Series A company revolutionizing how people dine. I'm passionate about technology and dedicated to leading a talented team of professionals shaping our company's future.

# Career Journey
My journey at Hungry Hub began right after graduating from university, where I started as a Software Engineer. With a keen interest in technology and a strong work ethic, I quickly rose through the ranks and assumed the role of CTO. In this capacity, I have built an exceptional engineering team and continue working alongside them to develop innovative solutions for our clients.

# Hungry Hub
Hungry Hub is an online table booking platform that offers exclusive fixed-price packages, allowing diners to know the bill beforehand while providing restaurants with a sustainable way to increase revenue. With over 1,500 restaurant partners, over 2 million diners served, and 1 million active users, Hungry Hub offers Dine-in, Staycation, and Delivery packages.

# Open Source Contributions
As a passionate coder, I take pride in giving back to the community by maintaining several [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/profiles/saiqulhaq). Contributing to open-source projects has been an advantageous experience, and I'm always looking for new opportunities to collaborate and learn from others.
