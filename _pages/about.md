Hi ðŸ‘‹ I am Saiqul, the CTO of Appservation Co, Ltd.  
Currently, I am joining [Lidr](https://www.lidr.co) class to improve myself as a CTO.

# Hungry Hub

Hungry Hub was the first company I worked with after graduating from university.Â Â 
I started my career as a software engineer, then became a CTO with 20 engineers.Â 
By the end of Dec 2022, Hungry Hub already has one million active users.

# Side projects:

* A few [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/profiles/saiqulhaq).
* A retail store that sells motorcycle accessories.
