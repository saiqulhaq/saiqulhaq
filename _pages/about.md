Hello! My name is Saiqul Haq, and I'm the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at Hungry Hub, a Series A company revolutionizing how people dine. I'm passionate about technology and dedicated to leading a talented team of professionals shaping our company's future.

# Career Journey
My journey at Hungry Hub began right after graduating from university, where I started as a Software Engineer. With a keen interest in technology and a strong work ethic, I quickly rose through the ranks and assumed the role of CTO. In this capacity, I have built an exceptional engineering team and continue working alongside them to develop innovative solutions for our clients.

# Hungry Hub
Hungry Hub is an online table booking platform that offers exclusive fixed-price packages, allowing diners to know the bill beforehand while providing restaurants with a sustainable way to increase revenue. With over 1,500 restaurant partners, over 2 million diners served, and 1 million active users, Hungry Hub offers Dine-in, Staycation, and Delivery packages.

# Open Source Contributions
As a passionate coder, I take pride in giving back to the community by maintaining several [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/profiles/saiqulhaq). Contributing to open-source projects has been an advantageous experience, and I'm always looking for new opportunities to collaborate and learn from others.

# Online Presence
I'm active on several platforms where I share my knowledge and interests with others. I have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGySLV8IIxp1Ef5GYAxWvgw) where I post tutorials on Ruby on Rails and anything else about technical. Additionally, I learn by reading other people's code on GitHub, and you can check out my projects at [https://github.com/saiqulhaq](https://github.com/saiqulhaq). For more casual content, you can also find me on [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@saiqulhaq), where I share exciting things around me.

# Hobbies and Interests
When I'm not busy leading the team at Hungry Hub or sharing my knowledge online, I enjoy reading, coding, and playing the FIFA mobile game. These activities allow me to unwind and recharge while staying connected to my passion for technology.

# Continuous Learning
As a CTO, I firmly believe in continuous learning and professional development. This commitment to growth benefits me personally and allows me to guide and inspire my team in their own professional journeys. I keep my skills sharp and stay informed about industry trends by reading books from O'Reilly and Gramedia, attending online webinars, and participating in the ["Ignite: Tech Leadership Bootcamp" bootcamp](https://www.lidr.co/en/ignite) by Alvaro Moya.
